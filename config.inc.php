// Note that timezones can be set on a per-area basis, so strictly speaking this

// the right timezone it is included here.
//
// When upgrading an existing installation, this should be set to the

/*******************
  * Themes
*******************/

// Choose a theme for the MRBS.   The theme controls two aspects of the look and feel:
//   (a) the styling:  the most commonly changed colours, dimensions and fonts have been
//       extracted from the main CSS file and put into the styling.inc file in the appropriate
//       directory in the Themes directory.   If you want to change the colour scheme, you should
//       be able to do it by changing the values in the theme file.    More advanced styling changes
//       can be made by changing the rules in the CSS file.
//   (b) the header:  the header.inc file which contains the function used for producing the header.
//       This enables organisations to plug in their own header functions quite easily, in cases where
//       the desired corporate look and feel cannot be changed using the CSS alone and the mark-up
//       itself needs to be changed.
//
//  MRBS will look for the files "styling.inc" and "header.inc" in the directory Themes/$theme and
//  if it can't find them will use the files in Themes/default.    A theme directory can contain
//  a replacement styling.inc file or a replacement header.inc file or both.

// Available options are:

// "default"        Default MRBS theme
// "classic126"     Same colour scheme as MRBS 1.2.6

$theme = "default";

$custom_css_url = 'css/index.css';

/* Add lines from systemdefaults.inc.php and areadefaults.inc.php below here
   to change the default configuration. Do _NOT_ modify systemdefaults.inc.php
   or areadefaults.inc.php.  */


   // This setting controls whether to use "clock" or "times" based intervals
   // (FALSE and the default) or user defined periods (TRUE).

   // $enable_periods is settable on a per-area basis.

   $enable_periods = FALSE;
   // Default value for new areas

   // TIMES SETTINGS
   // --------------

   // These settings are all set per area through MRBS. These are the default
   // settings that are used when a new area is created.

   // The "Times" settings are ignored if $enable_periods is TRUE.

   // Note: Be careful to avoid specifying options that display blocks overlapping
   // the next day, since it is not properly handled.

   // Resolution - what blocks can be booked, in seconds.
   // Default is half an hour: 1800 seconds.
   $resolution = (1 * 60); // DEFAULT VALUE FOR NEW AREAS

   // If the following variable is set to TRUE, the resolution of bookings
   // is forced to be the value of $resolution, rather than the resolution set
   // for the area in the database.
   $force_resolution = TRUE;


   // Start and end of day.
   // NOTE: The time between the beginning of the last and first
   // slots of the day must be an integral multiple of the resolution,
   // and obviously >=0.

   // The default settings below (along with the 30 minute resolution above)
   // give you 24 half-hourly slots starting at 07:00, with the last slot
   // being 18:30 -> 19:00

   // The beginning of the first slot of the day (DEFAULT VALUES FOR NEW AREAS)
   $morningstarts = 06; // must be integer in range 0-23

   $eveningends = 23; // must be integer in range 0-23
   $eveningends_minutes = 00; // must be integer in range 0-59

   // Example 1.
   // If resolution=3600 (1 hour), morningstarts = 8 and morningstarts_minutes = 30
   // then for the last period to start at say 4:30pm you would need to set eveningends = 16
   // and eveningends_minutes = 30

   // Example 2.
   // To get a full 24 hour display with 15-minute steps, set morningstarts=0; eveningends=23;
